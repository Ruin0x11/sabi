* It happens.
_Principles_
- Familiar places & persons.
- Combining things together.
- Random content.
- Comfortable repetition.

_Backbone_
- Feature-agnostic renderer (that is tightly coupled to game specifics)
- Heavy usage of prebuilt modules.
** Task
*** TODO Send a message to all actors in a radius.
*** TODO Create cosmetic decals for blood/cracks on tiles.
*** TODO A world generation.
Create a single deterministic layer from noise and, instead of looking at neighbors between regions, use the deterministic layer for generation
** Architecture Considerations
- Use a scripting language or not? Lua?
- Messaging between actors?
** Questions
_Design_
- Does there always have to be a player active?

_Technical_
- How do I keep a reference to an optional actor and be able to control it?
** Things I know I want
_Mechanics_
- Ranged weapons
- Themed dungeons/variety of generation patterns
- Numeric speed value
- Visibility/Invisibility/detection of invisible things
- Magic/events that happen after a set period of time
- Multi-turn actions that can be interrupted
- Variable amount of body parts.
- Some kind of crafting.
- Friendly AI/pets
- Friendly/Neutral/Hostile relations between all beings (infighting possible?)
- Large, persistent and randomly generated open world
- Home area of some kind
- No permadeath by default, but it is an option
  + although there still is a penalty for dying

_Theme_
- Something modern/abstract
*** Tiles
- Multiple items per tile
- At most one special feature - stairs.
  + Features can be added to a tile manually by the player
- Stairs are items, but not normally takeable
** Things to determine if fun
- TP/charge system of skills
- Player may balance between any amount of melee/shooting/magic
- Creation of temporary dungeons/dungeons from items
- Customization of home base
- Maintainance of city/large base
- Cell phone as quest acceptance/other tool
- Base building/defense as part of an instanced quest
- Items can act as living beings
- Open world not separated by boundaries (chunked) alongside normal maps
  + This is really cool, but /will/ require a rewrite...
- Overworld travel
- Hidden rooms (basements) of instanced buildings
